How this model works:
1. The average number of tries, penalties, drop goals, and conversion success rate for and against are collected for each team.
2. The stats are adjusted relative to previous opponents averaage stats, and then averaged.
3. The stats are added to the current opponents average in order to get expected number of scores and probability of a successful conversion.
4. Game scores are simulated using pseudorandom number generators following a Poisson distribution for the number, as well as treating conversions as binomial events.
5. 5 million games are simulated for each matchup in order to get each team's chance of winning and the distribution of scores.

Understanding the results:
CHANCE OF WINNING: The chance of each team winning, rounded to the nearest whole percent.
EXPECTED SCORE: The mean of each team's score distribution.
PERCENTILES: There's an n% chance of a score being at or below a given score in the n-th percentile.
